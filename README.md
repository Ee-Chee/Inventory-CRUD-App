# Online Inventory Application
* This app is developed for inventory management of Eat-Happy Sushi Shop. It enables users to check and update the amount of goods in the inventory (CRUD app). Unlike my previous projects, this project consists two parts of coding:
1) Backend Server (Nodejs)
2) Frontend Server (Angular 8)

In this repo, only frontend part is covered. Backend part can be found in the following link:

## Frontend Server
The app is already deployed on Heroku: https://eat-happy-inventur.herokuapp.com/. It uses Angular 8 framework and makes http requests to [backend](https://github.com/Ee-Chee/Inventory-App-Backend-Restful-API) whenever users make changes in the app.  

## Features
1) Bootstrap as CSS framework (responsive design)

2) Login, signup and logout functionalities

3) Authentication and validation form

4) Route guards

5) Goods and its corresponding amount are presented in accordion tables

6) Amount is piped in this form: Unit + Subunit

7) Goods amount substraction when items are taken out from the inventory

8) Goods amount addition when new items are added to the inventory

**_NOTES_**:
* Coding technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4 and Angular 8.
